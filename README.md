### Hi! my name is Christian
I am a versatile solution-oriented IT-creative with DevOps Awareness.

I live in Copenhagen Denmark, with my dog Diesel - she is a _Basset Hound Cocker Spaniel_ Mix (***Hush Basset***) - very cute!

I am on an exciting diversifying journey, where I explore a large area within **web development**, **system administration** and **k8's operations**. In this context I run my own public clusters, which I also use as a lab for:
- **running tests,**
- **developing web applications**
- **services for hosting services.**
- **setting up CI/CD pipelines.**

Since I find most areas super exciting, I have a great drive, which makes me feel good in an abundance of technologies. It provides the distraction I need, which keeps me inspired all the time.
I thrive really well when I work with innovation and development.
I enjoy tasks where I can combine technologies so that they end up being a **durable robust solutions**.

I am **currently** developing my **DevOps Awareness** skills, within DevOps and IDP processes ...

*Best Regards Christian.*
Cheers!*
