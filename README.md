### Hi! my name is Christian
I am a dynamic, curious, strategic-creative digital developer, living in Copenhagen with my dog Diesel - a _Basset Hound_ and _Cocker Spaniel_ cross breed. 

Currently on an exciting diversifying journey, where I explore a large area within **web development**, **system administration**,and **k8's operations**. In this context I'm administering true HA public cluster(s), which I also use as a lab for:
- **testing vclusters**
- **deploying web applications**
- **testing microservices for hosting**
- **setting up CI/CD pipelines**
For frontend I am currently digging:
- **Svelte/SvelteKit**  - again ðŸ˜„

Currently setting up a transparent hosting provider service for web agencies and developers.
Looking for like minded people who wants to make a difference.

*Cheers!*
