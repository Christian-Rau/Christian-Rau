# Hi! I'm Christian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dynamic and curious digital developer with a strategic-creative approach, based in Copenhagen. Welcome to my project!

## Svelte 5 AI assistant

I created an AI assistant with strict support for **Svelte 5**, focusing on best practices and efficient state management with runes. This project also integrates **Supabase** for backend services and features a custom, lower-level implementation of **TailwindCSS** for precise styling control.

Check out the custom GPT I built for this project [here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67f22c58490081918330d7a6bac03fc6-svelte-5-and-sveltekit).

## Features

- **AI Assistant**: Focuses on Svelte 5, leveraging runes for state management.
- **Supabase Integration**: Seamless backend services for data and authentication.
- **TailwindCSS**: Custom "lower" level configuration for utility-first styling.

*I'm always looking to improve this project. If you have ideas for additional features, feel free to contact me!*

## Technologies suported

- **Svelte 5**: For building the user interface with a focus on reactivity.
- **Supabase**: For backend services, including database and authentication.
- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-first styling with a custom configuration.


*Cheers!*
